            <h2>Why Manila</h2>
            <h3>Manila, as the "Pearl of the Orient".</h3>
            <p>
              Manila, the capital of the Philippines, is a densely populated
              bayside city on the island of Luzon, which mixes Spanish colonial
              architecture with modern skyscrapers. Intramuros, a walled city in
              colonial times, is the heart of Old Manila. It’s home to the
              baroque 16th-century San Agustin Church as well as Fort Santiago,
              a storied citadel and former military prison.
            </p>
            <p>
              Manila, known as the “Pearl of the Orient”, is the nation's
              capital city. This bustling historic city is full of things to see
              and do — including museums, parks, theaters, shopping malls and a
              plethora of restaurants to choose from.

                  They offer the best coffee and showed the best attitude to its
                  costumers. Internet connection is very fast and is unlimited
                  as well. The primary focus of the Starbucks brand, as Howard
                  Schultz put it, was the “meeting place between home and work,”
                  by transforming coffee into a customized experience.

                  The warm and cozy of the place invites you to stay from
                  breakfast through dinner. They have excellent coffee and
                  locally-sourced wines.

                  A neighborhood café in the heart of Manila. The staffs are
                  incredibly friendly and chatty. It has the best coffee in
