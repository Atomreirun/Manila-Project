            <h3>Manila, as the "Pearl of the Orient".</h3>
            <p>
              Manila, the capital of the Philippines, is a densely populated
              bayside city on the island of Luzon, which mixes Spanish colonial
              architecture with modern skyscrapers. Intramuros, a walled city in
              colonial times, is the heart of Old Manila. It’s home to the
              baroque 16th-century San Agustin Church as well as Fort Santiago,
              a storied citadel and former military prison.
            </p>
            <p>
              Manila, known as the “Pearl of the Orient”, is the nation's
              capital city. This bustling historic city is full of things to see
              and do — including museums, parks, theaters, shopping malls and a
              plethora of restaurants to choose from.

                  It's tiny! Not always easy to get a seat but it's such a cozy
                  little place, the food is always tasty and the staff are so
                  friendly. They offered the best coffee and showed the best
                  attitude to its costumers. Internet connection is very fast
                  and is unlimited as well. It was very quiet and
                  air-conditioned. I just want to keep coming back to this
                  place.

                  The warm and cozy of the place invites you to stay from
                  breakfast through dinner. They have excellent coffee and

                  A neighborhood café in the heart of Manila. The staffs are
                  incredibly friendly and chatty. It has the best coffee in
